# Unit 2: Fisheries Collapse Module

This module will focus on understanding and replicating fisheries stock assessment data and fisheries collapse.

Instead of working with independent data.frames, we will be working with a large relational database which contains many different tables of different sizes and shapes, but are all related to each other through a series of different ids.

## The Database

We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](https://www.ramlegacy.org/database/)

# Exercise 1: Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

First, we seek to replicate the following figure from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data.
```{r}
#!(http://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/cod.jpg)
```

![](http://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/cod.jpg)
```{r}
mcatch<-read_csv("RAMCore/MCatch.csv")
mcatch
```

Here we read in all the necessary sheets from the dataset.
```{r}
xlsx<-"Excel/RAMLDB v4.61 (assessment data only).xlsx"
readxl::excel_sheets(xlsx)

ts1<-read_xlsx(xlsx, sheet="timeseries.1")
ts2<-read_xlsx(xlsx, sheet="timeseries.2")
area<- read_xlsx(xlsx, sheet= "area")
stock<- read_xlsx(xlsx, sheet= "stock")
metrics<- read_xlsx(xlsx, sheet= "tsmetrics")
metrics
assess<- read_xlsx(xlsx, sheet="assessment")
```

Here we combined both "timeseries" datasheets (timeseries.1 and timeseries.2) and filtered them by TCbest-MT (Total catch in metric tons)
```{r}
ts<-bind_rows(ts1, ts2) |> 
  distinct()|> 
  filter(tsid=="TCbest-MT")
```

We want to see the most recent stock data for Atlantic Cod. This table displays all the assessid of the Atlantic cod.
```{r}
most_recent<-
  assess|>
  left_join(stock) |>
  filter(commonname=="Atlantic cod")|>
  filter(mostrecent==999)|>
  select(assessid)
most_recent
```

We are looking at all the CATCH or LANDINGS in Metric tons from the "metrics" data sheet.
```{r}
units<-metrics |> 
  filter(tscategory=="CATCH or LANDINGS") |>
  filter(tsunitslong=="Metric tons")
units
```

Next, we are combining the ts table with the "metrics" table we just created and reassigned "tsid" to the "tsunique" column.
```{r}
ts<-ts|> left_join(metrics, by=c("tsid"="tsunique"))
ts
```

Because we want to observe the regions in the East Coast, we decided to filter the "area" sheet by country (Canada) and subsequently by the distinct number of areacodes within Canada (there are 207 total).
```{r}
area |> 
  filter(country == "Canada") |>
  distinct(country, areacode)
```

We then created a table that is based on the ts data joined with the metrics, stock, and area. This allows us to create a comprehensive list of all species with their multiple identifiers. 
```{r}
fish <- ts|> 
  left_join(metrics, by=c("tsid"="tsunique"))|>
  left_join(stock)|>
  left_join(area)
fish
```

We want to only examine Atlantic cod as we are replicating the results from papers that looked into the collapse of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). To do this, we created a new table that only looked at Canadian cod by filtering by the scientific name and country. Afterwards, we joined that to the "most_recent" table as it contains information of the stock data Atlantic cod in Canada.
```{r}
cod <- fish |> 
  filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua") |>
  filter(country == "Canada") |>
  inner_join(most_recent, by = "assessid") 
cod
```
We are trying to find the specific stock used to generate the graphs in the published data. To do this, we filtered the data via stockid and areaid. In this case the relevant area ID was Canada-DFO-2J3KL. 
```{r}
cod_2J3KL <- fish |>
  filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua") |>
  filter(stockid == "COD2J3KL") |>
  filter(areaid == "Canada-DFO-2J3KL") |>
  inner_join(most_recent, by = "assessid")
cod_2J3KL
```
###Determining which Canadian cod stocks are considered collapsed
------
Once we determine the relevant stock in the specific area, we need to determine during which years the stock collapsed. In this case, collapsed is determined by whether the total catch was less than 10% of the historical maximum. However, the historical maximum is contingent to the time span of the data. 
```{r}
collapse<-cod_2J3KL |> 
  select(tsyear, tsvalue, stockid, areaid) |>
  mutate(collapsed = tsvalue < 0.1*max(tsvalue, na.rm=TRUE))
collapse
```
The following code replicates what was done previously, but instead of filtering by area ID, we determined the correct stock through trial and error of the area names. From there, we added the most recent data table, which contained information about total catch amounts. We then plotted this data by year and total catch. It should be noted that the original graph from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment contains data from 1850 to 2000. Since we filtered the data earlier to the more recent values, our graph starts in 1950. Data from before 1950 are excluded because it is not considered as reliable. The graph is the same as the one that would be produced from the area ID data, but instead is filtered by area name.
```{r}
cod |>
  filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua") |>
  filter(areaname == "Southern Labrador-Eastern Newfoundland") |>
  inner_join(most_recent, by = "assessid") |>
  group_by(tsyear) |>
  summarise(total = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(mapping=aes(tsyear, total)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```

Like the original graph, Atlantic cod stock peaks in the late 1960s and begins to decline, with stocks almost entirely collapsed by the mid 1990s.

# Exercise 2: Group Assignment

## Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](http://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/worm2006.jpg)
###Examining all Canadian cod stocks
-------------
Rather than beginning with all of the species, we first attempted to examine only a slightly larger data set that included all stocks of Canadian cod. The following chunks represent our initial attempts to calculate the collapse value for each stock. As you can see, we were largely unsuccessful. However, we kept these chunks for reference and to showcase our thought process while doing this exercise. 
```{r}
total_cod <- fish |> 
  filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua") |>
  filter(country == "Canada") |>
  inner_join(most_recent, by = "assessid") 
total_cod
```

```{r}
total_cod=total_cod |> 
  group_by(stockid)|>
  group_by(tsyear)|>
  mutate(collapsed=tsvalue<0.10* max(tsvalue, na.rm=TRUE))
```
```{r}
total_cod|>
  filter(collapsed==TRUE)|>
  ggplot(aes(x = tsyear, y = collapsed)) + geom_point()
total_cod
#Use taxa as species
#group by species and then sort by collapsed (true/false)
# calculate collapse value per stock 
```
###Examining all stocks in the database
-------
In order to examine all the species present in the data, we began with the earlier "fish" table. Again, we only wanted to examine total catch in metric tons. Because we want to filter the data by percent collapsed per species per year, the data had to be first grouped by year and scientific name. Then, we found the sum of the total catch values of each of the species in each year. After that, we added a column to the data that calculated whether or not the stock had collapsed based on the historical maximum. One column, is_collapse, represents whether each stock had collapsed per year. The other column, ever_collapse, calculates the total number of stocks that have collapsed up until and including that year. 
```{r}
all_species <- fish |>
  filter(tsid == "TCbest-MT") |>
  group_by(tsyear,scientificname) |>
  summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  group_by(scientificname) |>
  mutate(historical_max = cummax(total_catch), #historical maximum of catch 
        is_collapse = total_catch < 0.1 * historical_max, 
        ever_collapse = cumsum(is_collapse) > 0) #has the stock ever collapsed at any point in history, if so, value is greater than 0
#collapse value true if stock has dropped below 10% of historical maximum
all_species
```

The original study examined catch values from 1950 to 2003. Therefore, we had to assign this time span to a variable, time_span. From there, we were able to determine the number of species that had continuously appeared throughout this period. This was done by filtering the years to only those in the time span and counting the number of rows where the number of species appearances was equal to our specified time span. 
```{r}
time_span <- 1950:2003

recent_data <- nrow(all_species |>
                      group_by(scientificname, tsyear)|> 
                      filter(tsyear %in% time_span)|>
                      group_by(scientificname)|>
                      count()|>
                      filter(n == length(time_span)))
recent_data
#counting number of rows in specified time span where all of the data for the species appears in the time span 

#how many years each species is observed

```

After we established the number of species that would be present in this new data set (118), we could then calculate the collapse values for each species. The data was then input into a graph showing both the collapse values per year and the cumulative collapsed stocks. Like the original paper, both yearly stock collapses and cumulative collapses have increased over time. 
```{r}
all_species_prop<-all_species|> 
  filter(tsyear %in% time_span)|> 
  group_by(tsyear)|> 
  summarise(collapse=sum(is_collapse),
            ever_collapse=sum(ever_collapse))|>
  mutate(percent_collapse=(collapse/recent_data)*100) |>
  mutate(percent_collapse_cum=(ever_collapse/recent_data)*100)
all_species_prop

fish_plot<-ggplot(all_species_prop, aes(x=tsyear))+
  geom_line(aes(y=percent_collapse, col="Percent Collapsed"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=percent_collapse_cum, col="Cumulative Percent Collapsed"))+
  ggtitle("Global Fish Stocks Collapse")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Percent of Stocks Collapsed")+
    scale_y_reverse()
fish_plot

```

Something to note, however, that if the time span of the data changes; for example, if it ranges from 1950 to 2020, the number of species that appear would only be 2 (see below). It seems that in order to produce a graph that shows only collapsing stocks, it must be filtered exactly how the original paper used the data.  
```{r}

test_years<- 1950:2020
new_time <- nrow(all_species |>
                      group_by(scientificname, tsyear)|> 
                      filter(tsyear %in% test_years)|>
                      group_by(scientificname)|>
                      count()|>
                      filter(n == length(time_span)))
new_time

```
Another point to note is that the definition of collapse is rather limited, as it assumes that once a stock has collapsed within a certain year, it remains so and stays in the cumulative collapse values. However, some stocks actually did not remain collapsed. There are other limitations to the database discussed in Ricard et al. (2013), some of which include limited reporting in many parts of the world, with much of the data collected in the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, the stocks that have been assessed in the database represent a small proportion of total harvested stocks.
