# Unit 2: Fisheries Collapse Module

This module will focus on understanding and replicating fisheries stock assessment data and fisheries collapse.

Instead of working with independent data.frames, we will be working with a large relational database which contains many different tables of different sizes and shapes, but that all all related to each other through a series of different ids.

## The Database

We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](https://www.ramlegacy.org/database/)

# Exercise 1: Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

Now we are ready to dive into our data. First, We seek to replicate the following figure from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data.

mtcars %>% 
 ggplot(aes(disp, mpg)) + geom_point()

# Exercise 2: Group Assignment

## Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):
